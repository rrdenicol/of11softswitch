/* Flexible flow specifications (aka NXM = Nicira Extended Match).
 *
 * OpenFlow 1.0 has "struct ofp_match" for specifying flow matches.  This
 * structure is fixed-length and hence difficult to extend.  This section
 * describes a more flexible, variable-length flow match, called "nx_match" for
 * short, that is also supported by Open vSwitch.  This section also defines a
 * replacement for each OpenFlow message that includes struct ofp_match.
 *
 *
 * Format
 * ======
 *
 * An nx_match is a sequence of zero or more "nxm_entry"s, which are
 * type-length-value (TLV) entries, each 5 to 259 (inclusive) bytes long.
 * "nxm_entry"s are not aligned on or padded to any multibyte boundary.  The
 * first 4 bytes of an nxm_entry are its "header", followed by the entry's
 * "body".
 *
 * An nxm_entry's header is interpreted as a 32-bit word in network byte order:
 *
 * |<-------------------- nxm_type ------------------>|
 * |                                                  |
 * |31                              16 15            9| 8 7                0
 * +----------------------------------+---------------+--+------------------+
 * |            nxm_vendor            |   nxm_field   |hm|    nxm_length    |
 * +----------------------------------+---------------+--+------------------+
 *
 * The most-significant 23 bits of the header are collectively "nxm_type".
 * Bits 16...31 are "nxm_vendor", one of the NXM_VENDOR_* values below.  Bits
 * 9...15 are "nxm_field", which is a vendor-specific value.  nxm_type normally
 * designates a protocol header, such as the Ethernet type, but it can also
 * refer to packet metadata, such as the switch port on which a packet arrived.
 *
 * Bit 8 is "nxm_hasmask" (labeled "hm" above for space reasons).  The meaning
 * of this bit is explained later.
 *
 * The least-significant 8 bits are "nxm_length", a positive integer.  The
 * length of the nxm_entry, including the header, is exactly 4 + nxm_length
 * bytes.
 *
 * For a given nxm_vendor, nxm_field, and nxm_hasmask value, nxm_length is a
 * constant.  It is included only to allow software to minimally parse
 * "nxm_entry"s of unknown types.  (Similarly, for a given nxm_vendor,
 * nxm_field, and nxm_length, nxm_hasmask is a constant.)
 *
 *
 * Semantics
 * =========
 *
 * A zero-length nx_match (one with no "nxm_entry"s) matches every packet.
 *
 * An nxm_entry places a constraint on the packets matched by the nx_match:
 *
 *   - If nxm_hasmask is 0, the nxm_entry's body contains a value for the
 *     field, called "nxm_value".  The nx_match matches only packets in which
 *     the field equals nxm_value.
 *
 *   - If nxm_hasmask is 1, then the nxm_entry's body contains a value for the
 *     field (nxm_value), followed by a bitmask of the same length as the
 *     value, called "nxm_mask".  For each 1-bit in position J in nxm_mask, the
 *     nx_match matches only packets for which bit J in the given field's value
 *     matches bit J in nxm_value.  A 0-bit in nxm_mask causes the
 *     corresponding bits in nxm_value and the field's value to be ignored.
 *     (The sense of the nxm_mask bits is the opposite of that used by the
 *     "wildcards" member of struct ofp_match.)
 *
 *     When nxm_hasmask is 1, nxm_length is always even.
 *
 *     An all-zero-bits nxm_mask is equivalent to omitting the nxm_entry
 *     entirely.  An all-one-bits nxm_mask is equivalent to specifying 0 for
 *     nxm_hasmask.
 *
 * When there are multiple "nxm_entry"s, all of the constraints must be met.
 *
 *
 * Mask Restrictions
 * =================
 *
 * Masks may be restricted:
 *
 *   - Some nxm_types may not support masked wildcards, that is, nxm_hasmask
 *     must always be 0 when these fields are specified.  For example, the
 *     field that identifies the port on which a packet was received may not be
 *     masked.
 *
 *   - Some nxm_types that do support masked wildcards may only support certain
 *     nxm_mask patterns.  For example, fields that have IPv4 address values
 *     may be restricted to CIDR masks.
 *
 * These restrictions should be noted in specifications for individual fields.
 * A switch may accept an nxm_hasmask or nxm_mask value that the specification
 * disallows, if the switch correctly implements support for that nxm_hasmask
 * or nxm_mask value.  A switch must reject an attempt to set up a flow that
 * contains a nxm_hasmask or nxm_mask value that it does not support.
 *
 *
 * Prerequisite Restrictions
 * =========================
 *
 * The presence of an nxm_entry with a given nxm_type may be restricted based
 * on the presence of or values of other "nxm_entry"s.  For example:
 *
 *   - An nxm_entry for nxm_type=NXM_OF_IP_TOS is allowed only if it is
 *     preceded by another entry with nxm_type=NXM_OF_ETH_TYPE, nxm_hasmask=0,
 *     and nxm_value=0x0800.  That is, matching on the IP source address is
 *     allowed only if the Ethernet type is explicitly set to IP.
 *
 *   - An nxm_entry for nxm_type=NXM_OF_TCP_SRC is allowed only if it is preced
 *     by an entry with nxm_type=NXM_OF_ETH_TYPE, nxm_hasmask=0,
 *     nxm_value=0x0800 and another with nxm_type=NXM_OF_IP_PROTO,
 *     nxm_hasmask=0, nxm_value=6, in that order.  That is, matching on the TCP
 *     source port is allowed only if the Ethernet type is IP and the IP
 *     protocol is TCP.
 *
 * These restrictions should be noted in specifications for individual fields.
 * A switch may implement relaxed versions of these restrictions.  A switch
 * must reject an attempt to set up a flow that violates its restrictions.
 *
 *
 * Ordering Restrictions
 * =====================
 *
 * An nxm_entry that has prerequisite restrictions must appear after the
 * "nxm_entry"s for its prerequisites.  Ordering of "nxm_entry"s within an
 * nx_match is not otherwise constrained.
 *
 * Any given nxm_type may appear in an nx_match at most once.
 *
 *
 * nxm_entry Examples
 * ==================
 *
 * These examples show the format of a single nxm_entry with particular
 * nxm_hasmask and nxm_length values.  The diagrams are labeled with field
 * numbers and byte indexes.
 *
 *
 * 8-bit nxm_value, nxm_hasmask=1, nxm_length=1:
 *
 *  0          3  4   5
 * +------------+---+---+
 * |   header   | v | m |
 * +------------+---+---+
 *
 *
 * 16-bit nxm_value, nxm_hasmask=0, nxm_length=2:
 *
 *  0          3 4    5
 * +------------+------+
 * |   header   | value|
 * +------------+------+
 *
 *
 * 32-bit nxm_value, nxm_hasmask=0, nxm_length=4:
 *
 *  0          3 4           7
 * +------------+-------------+
 * |   header   |  nxm_value  |
 * +------------+-------------+
 *
 *
 * 48-bit nxm_value, nxm_hasmask=0, nxm_length=6:
 *
 *  0          3 4                9
 * +------------+------------------+
 * |   header   |     nxm_value    |
 * +------------+------------------+
 *
 *
 * 48-bit nxm_value, nxm_hasmask=1, nxm_length=12:
 *
 *  0          3 4                9 10              15
 * +------------+------------------+------------------+
 * |   header   |     nxm_value    |      nxm_mask    |
 * +------------+------------------+------------------+
 *
 *
 * Error Reporting
 * ===============
 *
 * A switch should report an error in an nx_match using error type
 * OFPET_BAD_REQUEST and one of the NXBRC_NXM_* codes.  Ideally the switch
 * should report a specific error code, if one is assigned for the particular
 * problem, but NXBRC_NXM_INVALID is also available to report a generic
 * nx_match error.
